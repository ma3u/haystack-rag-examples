  - Fruits: Moderate nutritional value, moderate points, grow longer
  - Sweets: Bad nutritional value, negative points, slow down, fatten, and shorten your snake
- Poops can be strategically placed on the game field:
  - Press space to drop poop behind your snake (reduces snake length)
  - Players who hit poop lose points and shrink
  - Using space multiple times drops multiple poops
